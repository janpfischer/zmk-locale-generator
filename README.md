# ZMK Locale Generator 

This Python module generates localized keyboard layout headers for [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) using data from the [Unicode CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr) or custom layouts in CLDR format.

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

## Usage

### Using a module

Add the [ZMK Locales module](https://github.com/joelspadin/zmk-locales) to your build to make all the generated headers available. See the documentation in that repo for more details.

### Using generated headers directly

If you do not want to use a module, or if you want to generate your own headers to use, then you can copy the header files directly into your config repo.

First, determine what keyboard layout your OS is set to, then [download the matching header from the latest release](https://github.com/joelspadin/zmk-locale-generator/releases) or follow [Generating Headers](#generating-headers) to build the header yourself. Place the header in your ZMK config repo's `config/` directory alongside your `.keymap` file.

Next, edit your `.keymap` file and add an include statement near the top. For example, if the header is named `keys_dvorak.h`, you would add

```c
#include "keys_dvorak.h"
```

You can now use the key codes defined in the header in your keymap bindings. For example:

```dts
#include <behaviors.dtsi>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>
#include "keys_dvorak.h"

/ {
  keymap {
    compatible = "zmk,keymap";

    default_layer {
      bindings = <
        &kp DV_GRAVE &kp DV_N1 &kp DV_N2      ...
        &kp TAB       &kp DV_SQT &kp DV_COMMA ...
        &kp CAPS       &kp DV_A &kp DV_O      ...
        &kp LSHIFT      &kp DV_SEMI &kp DV_Q  ...
        &kp LCTRL &kp LGUI &kp LALT           ...
      >;
    }
  };
};
```

## Generating Headers

### Setup

Install [Pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/), then use it to install ZMK Locale Generator:

```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/joelspadin/zmk-locale-generator.git
```

### Usage

The following command will generate a header for every keyboard layout defined in [keyboards/keyboards.yaml](keyboards/keyboards.yaml) and write them to a directory named `out`:

```sh
zmk_locale_generator all
```

The following command will generate a header for a single locale:

```sh
zmk_locale_generator single <PREFIX> <CLDR_FILE>
```

Where:

- `<PREFIX>` is a prefix to attach to all key code names, e.g. `DE` for German.
- `<CLDR_FILE>` is the path to an XML file formatted similar to the ones from the [Unicode CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/tree/maint/maint-43/keyboards).

For example:

```sh
zmk_locale_generator single DE de-t-k0-windows.xml
```

This will print the generated header to stdout. To write the header to a file instead, use `--out`. For example:

```sh
zmk_locale_generator single DE de-t-k0-windows.xml --out keys_de.h
```

For more usage information, run

```sh
zmk_locale_generator --help
```

## Contributing

PRs are welcome, especially to add new keyboard layouts or improve key names.

### Setup

Optional: create a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to ensure this project doesn't conflict with global packages:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

After creating the venv, [activate it](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work) as necessary for the shell you are using.

Install the package in editable mode:

```sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Optional: install a Git pre-commit hooks and additional code checkers. This will check your code as you commit it, so you don't have to wait for feedback from GitHub when you make a pull request.

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), then run:

```sh
npm install
```

### Add a Keyboard Layout

First, edit [zmk_locale_generator/keyboards/keyboards.yaml](zmk_locale_generator/keyboards/keyboards.yaml) and add a new item to the list:

1. Create a keyboard layout file in CLDR format and place it in the `keyboards` directory, or select an existing file from the `cldr` repo.
2. Add a new item to `keyboards.yaml` with a `path` key followed by the relative path from `keyboards.yaml` to the CLDR file.
3. If key names should be prefixed with something different than the first word of the file name, add a `prefix` key followed by the prefix.
4. If the generated header name should be different than the prefix or there is already another keyboard layout using the same prefix, add a `filename` key followed by a unique name. (The script will automatically add `keys_` to the beginning and `.h` to the end, so you should not include those in the name.)
5. If the layout has its own license, add a `license` key followed by the relative path to a text file containing the license.
   - If a license is not specified, it uses the Unicode CLDR license.

For example:

```yaml
- path: colemak.xml
  prefix: cm
  filename: colemak
  license: colemak-LICENSE.txt
```

### Update Codepoints

Next, run `zmk_locale_generator update_codepoints` to make sure [codepoints.yaml](zmk_locale_generator/codepoints.yaml) includes entries for all characters used in the keyboard layout:

```sh
zmk_locale_generator update_codepoints
```

Finally, edit [codepoints.yaml](zmk_locale_generator/codepoints.yaml) and assign names to any codepoints that were added. (New codepoints will have `''` for the name.)
